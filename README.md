# Golden Ratio via Fibonacci Squares
## Overview
This project explores a novel method for approximating the golden ratio (\( \phi \approx 1.618033988749895 \)) using the squares of Fibonacci numbers, revealing a connection to the golden angle (\(\approx 137.5077^\circ\), ratio \( 1 - \frac{1}{\phi} \approx 0.381966 \)). The approach leverages the Fibonacci sequence and its properties, with potential implications for mathematics and natural pattern modeling (e.g., NASAâ€™s June 25, 2025, space agriculture study).
## Method
Define the ratio:
\[
r_n = \frac{F_n^2}{\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} F_k^2}
\]
where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number (\( F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, \ldots \)).
- Examples:
  - \( r_3 = \frac{2^2}{1^2 + 1^2} = 2 \)
  - \( r_4 = \frac{3^2}{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} = 1.5 \)
  - \( r_5 = \frac{5^2}{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} \approx 1.666667 \)
- By \( F_{16} = 987 \), \( r_{16} \approx 1.618034 \), approaching \( \phi \).
- The sum of differences \( \Delta r_n = r_{n+1} - r_n \) from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 16 \) approximates 0.381966.
## Verification
Using the identity \( \sum_{k=1}^n F_k^2 = F_n \cdot F_{n+1} \), the ratio simplifies to \( r_n = \frac{F_n}{F_{n-1}} \), and \( r_{n+1} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} \to \phi \) as \( n \to \infty \). The difference sum aligns with \( 1 - \frac{1}{\phi} \) due to the alternating series \( \sum \frac{(-1)^n}{F_n F_{n-1}} \).

## Discussion
While the method reduces to the known \( \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} \) ratio, the focus on squares and difference sums offers a unique perspective. This may inspire further research in AI-assisted number theory (xAI blog, June 20, 2025) or natural pattern analysis.
## Next Steps
- Planning submission to the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM 2025, Philadelphia, July 2025).
